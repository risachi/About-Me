        All you have to learn here is how to have fun.
        Just let this happen.
        We just let this flow right out of our minds.
        If you don't like it - change it.
        It's your world.
        All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.
        You can't have light without dark.
        You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.
        Trees grow however makes them happy.
        You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.
        Only think about one thing at a time.
        Don't get greedy.
        In this world, everything can be happy.
